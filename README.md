Fuel Efficiency Prediction - ReadMe
Project Title: Fuel Efficiency Prediction Using Vehicle Characteristics
Researcher: Ronnie McLovin
ORCID ID: 0009-0006-7325-8135
Dataset: Vehicle Performance Data
Metadata Standard: Data Documentation Initiative (DDI)

Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict the fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon, MPG) of vehicles based on a set of key characteristics such as the number of cylinders, engine displacement, horsepower, vehicle weight, acceleration, model year, and origin of the vehicle. This prediction model aims to assist manufacturers and consumers in understanding the factors that most significantly impact fuel efficiency and to optimize vehicle designs for better performance.

Fuel efficiency has always been a major consideration for automotive engineers and environmental policy-makers. The growing concerns over fuel consumption, emissions, and energy sustainability make it imperative to develop models that can predict the efficiency of different types of vehicles accurately.

This ReadMe file provides comprehensive details about the dataset, metadata, data dictionary, and the methodology followed in the project. It also discusses the challenges faced and the solutions that helped in overcoming them.

1. Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this project contains various performance metrics and characteristics of vehicles. Each observation in the dataset corresponds to a vehicle, and the attributes represent different measurable properties.

The column names of the dataset are as follows:

MPG (Miles Per Gallon): The fuel efficiency of the vehicle, measured in miles per gallon. This is the target variable.
Cylinders: The number of engine cylinders.
Displacement: The engine's total displacement in cubic inches.
Horsepower: The horsepower output of the engine.
Weight: The weight of the vehicle in pounds.
Acceleration: The time it takes for the vehicle to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour (in seconds).
Model Year: The year the vehicle model was manufactured.
Origin: The country or region where the vehicle was manufactured (represented numerically, e.g., 1 for USA, 2 for Europe, and 3 for Japan).
The goal is to predict the MPG of a vehicle based on the other features in the dataset.

2. Data Dictionary
A data dictionary is an essential element in documenting a dataset, as it provides a clear description of each variable, the data type, and any relevant notes on the data values.

Column Name	Description	Data Type	Notes
MPG	Miles per gallon (Fuel Efficiency)	Float	Target variable for prediction. Continuous value.
Cylinders	Number of engine cylinders	Integer	Typically ranges from 3 to 12 cylinders.
Displacement	Engine displacement in cubic inches	Float	Continuous variable.
Horsepower	Horsepower output of the engine	Float	Some values may be missing or need imputation.
Weight	Weight of the vehicle in pounds	Float	Continuous variable.
Acceleration	Time taken to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (in seconds)	Float	Continuous variable.
Model Year	Year the vehicle model was manufactured	Integer	Ranges from 1970 to 1982 in this dataset.
Origin	Country or region of manufacture (1=USA, 2=Europe, 3=Japan)	Integer	Categorical variable.
Notes on Data Quality:
Missing Data: In some cases, values for Horsepower are missing. A strategy for handling missing data (imputation or removal) is necessary.
Outliers: Extreme values for variables such as Weight or Acceleration might exist and need to be checked.
Normalization: Features like Displacement and Weight may require normalization or scaling due to their large value ranges.
